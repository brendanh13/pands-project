# This is the README file for the Programming and Scripting Module Final Project for 2022

Summary of the Project and what needs to be done:

i.      Based on well-known data set called "Iris data set"
ii.     Research the data set
iii.    Investigate the data set by creating documentation and writing code in Python
iv.     Present all output as the project for review / assessment

The key takeaway from the problem statment provided that I want to try follow;

"Imagine that you are to give a presentation on the data set in a few weeks’ time, where you explain what investigating a data set entails and how 
Python can be used to do it.......present your code and it's output to them."


Section 1 - Research

Online investigation of this data set has directed me to a large array of prior research and analysis of the Iris data set which has been already completed.
One such location outlined what the dataset is in simple terms - "It describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flowers, specifically, the length and width of both pedals and the sepals, which are part of the flower’s reproductive system" [1] Upon further reading - it has become clear that the Iris data set has become a fundamental part of the computing world and has been used extensively - even going as far as describing it as "perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature" [2]

The UCI Machine Learning Repository [2] gives us a more precise indication of what is included in the data set:

- The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 
- The attributes contains information as below:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica

Given the information I have gathered so far - I now believe I am in a position to begin assesing the data set.

Section 2 - Initial Analysis / Thoughts

Before I start; I am asking myself what types of things do I want to or could could I find out about the data set and what learnings will I be able to state?

I will jot down these below and use them as I proceed through the analysis (I am keen to do this as I want to try put my own stamp on this instead of potentially being directed too much by the research / analysis available across the internet)

1. What are the data types?
2. Is there any missing data?
3. Confirm there are 50 of each of the 3 species of Iris
4. What are the basic characteristics of each Iris and can I make a simple determination of them...e.g are the petal lengths or width of one species much smaller than the other(s)?
5. Are any of the classes very similar or dissimilar? e.g if I chose a random Iris - would I be able to state with any certainty which species it may or may not be.

Section 3 - Tools / Methods

Which tools / methods will I use for this project?

tbd - I want to explore the data first before deciding on final approach

Firstly - I will start to take a look at the data using a Python program in Visual Studio

Secondly - I am going to try a Juypter Notebook as I feel this might be a better way to present the Project

Section 4 - Analysis

The analsys I am presenting will be primarily presented within a Jupyter Notebook while I will also have a small Python programme called analysis.py that will be used to supplement the Jupyter Notebook by creating further data and visual outputs.
